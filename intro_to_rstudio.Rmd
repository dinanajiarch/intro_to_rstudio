# Introduction to R and RStudio

This walkthrough is presented by the IMMERSE team and will go through some common tasks carried out in R.
There are many free resources available to get started with R and RStudio.
One of our favorites is [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PART 1: Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 0: Install R, RStudio, and Mplus

[Here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) you will find a guide to installing both R and R Studio.
You can also install Mplus [here](https://www.statmodel.com/orderonline/).

*Note*: The installation of Mplus requires a paid license with the mixture add-on.
IMMERSE fellows will be given their own copy of Mplus for use during the one year training.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PART 2: Set-up

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Create a new R-project in RStudio

R-projects help us organize our folders , filepaths, and scripts.
To create a new R project:

-   File --\> New Project...

Click "New Directory" --\> New Project --\> Name your project

### Step 2: Create an R-markdown document

An R-markdown file provides an authoring framework for data science that allows us to organize our reports using texts and code chunks.
This document you are reading was made using R-markdown!

To create an R-markdown:

-   File --\> New File --\> R Markdown...

In the window that pops up, give the R-markdown a title such as "**Introduction to R and RStudio**" Click "OK." You should see a new markdown with some example text and code chunks.
We want a clean document to start off with so delete everything from line 10 down.
Go ahead and save this document to your Google Drive folder.

### Step 3: Load packages

Your first code chunk in any given markdown should be the packages you will be using.
To insert a code chunk, etiher use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + i or Code --\> Insert Chunk or click the green box with the letter C on it.
There are a few packages we want our markdown to read in:

```{r}
library(haven) #for read_sav() function
library(psych) # describe()
library(here) #helps with filepaths
library(tidyverse) #collection of R packages designed for data science
```

As a reminder, if a function does not work and you receive an error like this: `could not find function "random_function"`; or if you try to load a package and you receive an error like this: `` there is no package called `random_package` `` , then you will need to install the package using `install.packages("random_package")` in the console (the bottom-left window in R studio).
Once you have installed the package you will *never* need to install it again, however you must *always* load in the packages at the beginning of your R markdown using `library(random_package)`, as shown in this document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 3: Explore the data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Read in data

The data sets used in this walkthrough are used in Chapter 4 of Tabachnick & Fidell (2012).
The chapter is a useful resource if you need more information on how to clean and screen your data and write up the results.

Here is a table of the variables and their description:

|              |                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Variable** | **Description**                |
| subno        | Subject/Participant number     |
| timedrs      | Visits to health professionals |
| attdrug      | Attitudes toward medication    |

The style of code and package we will be using for this class is called [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) .
Most functions are within the `tidyverse` package and if not, I've indicated the packages used in the code chunk above.

**To read in data in R**:

```{r}
data <- read_sav(here("data", "health.sav"))

# Ways to view data in R:
# 1. click on the data in your Global Environment (upper right pane) or use...
View(data)
# 2. summary() gives basic summary statistics & shows number of NA values
# *great for checking that data has been read in correctly*
summary(data)
# 3. names() provides a list of column names. Very useful if you don't have them memorized!
names(data)
# 4. head() prints the top x rows of the dataframe
head(data)
```

You can also look at the dataframe with labels and response scale meta-data:

```{r}
sjPlot::view_df(data)
```

This SPSS dataset gives us more information than the *.dat*Â one.
We are able to see the variable names, and descriptions.

**Convert from *.sav* to *.csv***

Usually, we want to work with .csv files, so let's convert this data set from *.sav* to *.csv* and save it to our computers.
Here is how to convert the ***.sav*** **to *.csv***:

```{r}
# write_csv saves a .csv version of your dataset to your working directory.
# Enter the name of the object that contains your data set (in this case, "health_data.csv"), then enter the name you want to save your dataset as. We can call it the same thing: "health.csv"
write_csv(data, here("data", "health_data.csv"))

# read the unlabeled data back into R
data_csv <- read_csv(here("data", "health_data.csv"))
```

Use `names()` to view the variable names in the data set:

```{r}
names(data_csv)
```

### Step 5: Descriptive Statistics

Let's look at descriptive statistics for each variable.
Because looking at the ID variable's (`subno`) descriptives is unnecessary, we use `select()` to remove the variable by using the minus (`-`) sign:

```{r}
data_csv %>% 
  select(-subno) %>% 
  summary()
```

Alternatively, we can use the `psych::describe()` function to give more information:

```{r}
data_csv %>% 
  select(-subno) %>% 
  describe()
```

What if we want to look at a subset of the data?
For example, what if we want to subset the data to see whose been to the doctor more than 10 times?
We can use `tidyverse::filter()` to subset the data using certain criteria.

```{r}
data_csv %>% 
  filter(timedrs > 10) %>% 
  describe() 

#You can use any operator to filter: >, <, ==, >=, etc.
```
